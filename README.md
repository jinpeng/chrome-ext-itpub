Itpub Download
================
This Chrome extension was made to simplify the operation of download attachments from http://itpub.net.
- Go to itpub forum page, see attachments that the page contains
- Filter them by title, supports wildcard and regex
- Select attachments to download by clicking on the titles
- Use dedicated buttons to download
- Hide filters, buttons and notifications if you don't need

When you press the "Download" button, all selected attachments are saved to the default download directory of Chrome, or to a directory inside it if you specify a subfolder name.

WARNING: If you haven't set up a default download directory, you will have to manually choose the save location for each image, which might open a lot of popup windows. It is not recommended to attempt to download too many attachments at once without a default download directory.

Known Issues
================
This extension can only handles the attachments of the itpub forum, but could not handle the contents hosted on pan.baidu.com or other cloud disk yet.

Change Log
